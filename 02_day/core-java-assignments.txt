Day 2

1. Solve Tank assignment along with memory picture.

class Tank {
  private int level;
  Tank(int l)
   {
     level=l;
   }
  public void setLevel(int level1)
  {
    level=level1;
  }
  public int getLevel()
  {
    return level;
  }
}	

public class Assignment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tank t1 = new Tank(10);
    Tank t2 = new Tank(20);
   
    s.o.p("1: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1 = t2;
    s.o.p("2: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t1.setLevel(27);
     s.o.p("3: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
    t2.setLevel(t1.getLevel()+10);
     s.o.p("4: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());
  }
}


2. Create java application for the following.
Create Student class in a package "com.cdac.core" 
2.1 Every student must have   --- id(int) --if possible system generated(think!!!), name (String), email(String), age(int), gpa (double)

2.2 Add suitable parameterized constructor.
Don't accept gpa in constructor , since it has to be computed.

2.3 Add a method getDetails to  fetch student details
(ret type -- String)

2.4  Add computeGPA method in Student class
Accept 3 scores for quiz , test & assignments
GPA should be computed on 20 % of quiz score, 50% of test score & 30% of assignment score.

3 Write a TestStudents class in "com.tester" package , to accept 2 student details(w/o gpa)
Compute GPAs by passing scores.
Display name of student having higher GPA.

OPTIONAL
4. Write a TestStudents2 class in "com.tester" package.
Accept how many students in the class from user.
 
 Accept student details(w/o gpa)
Accept student scores & compute GPAs .
Display name of student having highest GPA.
